# Serendipity Key [Full Screen]

- Serendipity is the luck some people have in finding or creating interesting or valuable things by chance.
- The birth of this control layout came from an accident.
- For us, it holds great significance.
- Thus, we named it Serendipity Key.
- The Chinese name is "Beautiful, Unexpected Encounter."
